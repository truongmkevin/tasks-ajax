# AJAX Task App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/truongmkevin/tasks-ajax.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/truongmkevin/tasks-ajax)

I created this app during my time at Tech Talent South Spring 2015 cohort.

It is a Rails app that allows a user to manage their tasks, and the views are generated using JavaScript.
